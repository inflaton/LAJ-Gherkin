              "Authentication negative cases covered: missing and invalid tokens producing 401 responses (TC09, TC10).",

              "Add rate limiting tests that simulate bursts to trigger throttling and assert 429 status and Retry-After header and graceful degradation.",
              "Add pagination boundary tests: verify default limit=100 when omitted, behavior when offset exceeds result set returns empty array, and server behavior when limit exceeds maximum allowed.",
              "Add authorization scope tests to cover 403 Forbidden cases where credentials are valid but lack required permissions.",

              "Move heavy load and concurrency tests to a dedicated performance test suite and use tooling suited for non functional tests; keep functional tests deterministic by seeding data and mocking dependencies.",
