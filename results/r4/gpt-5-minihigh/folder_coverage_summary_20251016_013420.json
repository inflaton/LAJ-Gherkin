            "Add pagination tests: verify limit/offset or page/token semantics, behavior when requesting pages beyond range, page size limits, and correct filtering when paginating.",

            "Add rate-limiting tests: simulate bursts to validate 429 responses, Retry-After header, and graceful degradation strategies.",
            "Add authorization (403) tests: verify behaviour for authenticated users without admin privileges and ensure proper role-based access control errors are returned.",
            "Validate octet-stream content: add tests to deserialize/parse the returned stream, verify integrity (content-length/checksum), correct ordering/format of queue entry records, and chunked transfer behavior.",
            "Add negative validation tests for boolean and other param types: supply invalid booleans and unexpected types to ensure 400 responses and robust input validation.",
            "Test Accept-header handling and content negotiation: validate behavior for clients that request other media types and document expected behavior (406 or fallback).",

            "Expand date tests: include timezone offsets, multiple accepted date formats (ISO8601 variants), and boundary checks to remove ambiguity."
