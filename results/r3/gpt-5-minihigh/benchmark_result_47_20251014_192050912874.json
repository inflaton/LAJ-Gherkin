              "Authentication failures: TC02 and TC03 cover missing and invalid credentials producing 401 responses.",
              "Error status coverage: TC04, TC05, TC06, TC07, and TC14 exercise a range of error conditions and codes (404, 500, 503, 400, 504) as required by the story.",
              "Security and input validation: TC07 and TC08 handle malformed requests and injection attempts (400/403), addressing input-sanitization concerns.",
              "Concurrency and performance: TC10 tests concurrent DELETE requests, response-time expectations, and checks for race conditions.",

              "Add structured response validation for error cases: validate JSON schema, field types and semantics rather than only substring checks on message text.",
