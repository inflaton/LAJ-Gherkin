Authorization and access control: TC07 (missing header) and TC10 (unauthorized access). Error handling and resilience: TC11 (system error), TC12 (network timeout). Edge cases and robustness: TC06 (non-existent account), TC15 (regression - repeated deletion), TC18 (state variation), TC16 (concurrency under load), TC13 (large number of IDs), TC14 (duplicate IDs).
