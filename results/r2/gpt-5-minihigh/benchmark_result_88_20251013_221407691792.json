              "Add rate-limiting tests: simulate request bursts to ensure safe handling (expect 429 or system-specific behavior) and measure recovery/backoff behavior.",
              "Add cache-invalidation tests if relevant: verify any caches are invalidated after deletion and that subsequent GETs reflect current state; at minimum assert Cache-Control/ETag behavior if the API returns these headers.",
              "Harden concurrency tests: extend TC17 to verify conflict semantics (e.g., one request wins, others get 409 or are no-ops) and assert no data corruption under concurrent deletions; include stepped concurrency (overlapping tag sets).",
